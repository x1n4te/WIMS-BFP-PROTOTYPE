# fix: AFOR import gaps, data persistence, audit trails, UI/UX polish

## Summary

- AFOR XLSX import: General Description, Alarm Commanders, "Others" free-text (C219), and Prepared/Noted by now correctly read and stored
- AFOR import blocked when XLSX region doesn't match encoder's assigned region
- Encoder region lock hardened: province/city cleared if pre-filled from wrong region; save validates province belongs to encoder's region
- All edited fields (owner name, general description, vehicles affected, floor/land area) now persist correctly on edit
- Prepared by / Noted by block submission when blank or set to "N/A" (both create and edit paths)
- Regional dashboard location fixed — was always showing "Agoncillo, Batangas" due to hardcoded ref IDs
- Validator Audit Trail 500 error fixed; pagination added (15/page) with username, role, region, and action filters
- Encoder Activity Log pagination added (15/page) with action, city, and date filters; added to sidebar
- Validator and Encoder dashboards paginate at 10 incidents
- Validator Audit Trail added as sidebar tab for NATIONAL_VALIDATOR
- Map picker rejects coordinates outside Philippine bounds; search box always visible above map
- Alarm timeline date/time display split into separate Date and Time columns with Commander column
- Province/city/district validated before draft save and before submit; missing fields popup catches "N/A" stored values
- Extent of Damage radio change clears stale sub-fields; floor/land area edits now persist
- Region field rendered as plain text for encoders (no dropdown arrow)
- Accept/Reject buttons hidden while reject textarea is open
- Validator audit UUID filter replaced with username text search + role dropdown
- Validator dashboard encoder UUID filter replaced with region dropdown
- "VALIDATOR" role included in `is_validator` check (was causing 404s)
- `extent_description` and `extent_objects_count` now persisted from manual entry form
- XLSX import now logs `CREATED_DRAFT` in Activity Log
- Back-to-dashboard buttons styled yellow for visibility

## Key Bug Fixes

### AFOR XLSX Import — Data Gaps
Four fields were not reaching the database from XLSX import: (1) General Description was parsed but never written to the stored JSON; (2) Incident/Ground Commander names (column F) were not read for any of the 13 alarm level rows; (3) "Others" problem checkbox appended the literal string "Others" but ignored the free-text in C219; (4) Prepared by / Noted by read from the label row (C238/F238) instead of the data row (C239/E239).

### Regional Dashboard — Wrong Location
Every manually-created incident stored `city_id = 1` due to hardcoded values in the create payload. The list query joined the ref_cities table, always returning city #1 (Agoncillo, Batangas) regardless of the actual incident location. Fixed by removing the hardcoded IDs and switching the list query to use the city_municipality/province_district text columns directly.

### Edited Fields Not Persisting
Several fields were excluded from the update path: owner_name was blob-only (plaintext column never written); general_description_of_involved and vehicles_affected were not in IncidentUpdateRequest; floor/land area fields were not in the update payload. All now persist correctly on edit.

### Validator Audit Trail 500 Error
The paginated audit-log COUNT query was missing the JOIN on wims.users, causing a SQL error whenever the actor_username or role filter was applied. Added the same LEFT JOIN to the COUNT query.

### Prepared by / Noted by Accepted "N/A"
The form payload defaulted empty values to the string "N/A", which passed all existing checks. Added pre-submit validation in both the create form and the edit/submit path that blocks submission when either field is blank or equals "N/A" (case-insensitive).

### VALIDATOR Role — 404 on Incident Detail
The is_validator check in regional.py did not include the "VALIDATOR" role string, routing those users through the encoder branch which filters by encoder_id — returning 404 for any incident they didn't create.

### Extent of Damage — Stale Sub-Fields
Switching the Extent of Damage radio left previous sub-field values (floor area, land area, description, objects count) in form state. Those stale values were included in the submission. The radio handler now clears all sub-fields on each change, and floor/land area are included in the update payload.

## Migrations

Run on fresh container start automatically. To apply to an existing database:

```sql
-- Migration 25
ALTER TABLE wims.incident_nonsensitive_details
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS extent_description TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS extent_objects_count INT;

-- Migration 28
ALTER TABLE wims.incident_nonsensitive_details
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS general_description_of_involved TEXT;
```

## Test Checklist

- [ ] Import a filled XLSX → Activity Log shows "Created Draft"; incident shows General Description, Commander names, "Others: \<text\>", and correct Prepared/Noted by
- [ ] Import XLSX with a different region as encoder → error shown naming both regions, no redirect
- [ ] Log in as VALIDATOR role user → open any incident → detail view loads (no 404)
- [ ] Create manual AFOR, select Extent of Damage with sub-fields → switch to another option → sub-fields clear; save → verify only the relevant fields persisted
- [ ] Edit existing incident: change owner name, general description, vehicles affected, floor area → save → all changes appear in detail view and list
- [ ] Try submitting with Prepared by blank or "N/A" → validation blocks submission in both create form and detail view
- [ ] Open Regional Dashboard → incident rows show correct city and province (not "Agoncillo, Batangas")
- [ ] Click map outside Philippines bounds → error shown, pin does not move
- [ ] Open incident with alarm timeline → Date (MM-DD-YYYY) and Time (HH:MM) appear in separate columns; Commander column present
- [ ] Validator Audit Trail: apply Username filter → results filter correctly (no 500 error)
- [ ] Encoder Activity Log: apply action and city filters; pagination controls show (15/page)
- [ ] Validator dashboard: if >10 incidents, pagination controls appear
- [ ] Validator Audit Trail visible in sidebar for NATIONAL_VALIDATOR
- [ ] Rebuild: `cd src && docker-compose up -d --build backend frontend`
